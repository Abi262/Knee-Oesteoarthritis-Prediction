# Knee-Oesteoarthritis-Prediction
#Knee osteoarthritis is a pathology that occurs due to wear on the cartilage that protects the bones in this region from friction and impacts.
Some medical procedures are necessary to identify this pathology, such as X-rays or magnetic resonance imaging, in which it is possible to assess the loss in joint spacing, thus indicating the severity of the disease.
The severity of osteoarthritis was classified into 5 levels based on KL score, from the healthy level to the severe level, where the greater the degree of severity, the smaller the spacing of the joint.
KL score:
Grade 0: Healthy
Grade 1: Doubtful
Grade 2: Minimal
Grade 3: Moderate
Grade 4: Severe
The purpose of this project is to correctly classify the severity of osteoarthritis based on X-ray images.
