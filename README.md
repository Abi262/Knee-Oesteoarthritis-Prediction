# Knee-Oesteoarthritis-Prediction
Knee osteoarthritis is a pathology that occurs due to wear on the cartilage that protects the bones in this region from friction and impacts.
<br>
Some medical procedures are necessary to identify this pathology, such as X-rays or magnetic resonance imaging, in which it is possible to assess the loss in joint spacing, thus indicating the severity of the disease.
<br>
The severity of osteoarthritis was classified into 5 levels based on KL score, from the healthy level to the severe level, where the greater the degree of severity, the smaller the spacing of the joint.
<br>
# KL score:
<br>
Grade 0: Healthy
<br>
Grade 1: Doubtful
<br>
Grade 2: Minimal
<br>
Grade 3: Moderate
<br>
Grade 4: Severe
<br>
The purpose of this project is to correctly classify the severity of osteoarthritis based on X-ray images.
